.SH NAME
simple_shell - Holberton School Simple Shell

-SH PROLOGUE
.PP
A shell is an application that allows interacting with the computer. In a shell the user can run programs and also redirect the output to a file.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell format [[command line][argumment...]]...


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Our Shell is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from standard input and executes them.

.SS Invocation
.PP
Our Shell can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively.
It reads and executes received commands in order.

.SS Commands
.PP
The shell interprets the words it reads according to a language, the specification of which is outside the scope of this man page (refer to the BNF in the POSIX 1003.2 document). Essentially though, a line is read and if the first word of the line (or after a control operator)is not a reserved word, then the shell recognizes it a simple command.


.SS Path Search
.PP
To locate a command, the shell first checks if there is a shell function by that name. If it doesn't find it, it looks for a built-in command by that name. If a built-in command is not found, there is two possibilities:

.RS
.ns
1.      Command names preceded by a slash are simply executed without performing any searches.

2.      The shell searches each path in $PATH for the command. The value of the PATH variable should be a series of entries separated by colons. Each entry consists of a directory name, the current directory may be indicated implicitly by an empty directory name, or explicitly by a single period.
.RE

.SS Command Exit Status
.PP
Each command has an exit status that affects the behaviour of other shell commands. A command exits with for success, and non-zero for failure, error, or false indication. The man page for each command should indicate their various exit codes.

Errors that are detected by the shell, such as a syntax error, will cause the shell to exit with a non-zero exit status. If the shell is not in interactive mode, the execution of the shell file will be aborted. Otherwise the shell will return the exit status of the last command executed, or if the exit built-in is used with a numeric argument, it will return the argument.

.SS ENVIRONMENT
 
        PATH    The default search path for executables. See the above section Path Search.



.SH EXAMPLES

.SS In interactive mode
.B
 $ ./hsh
 #$ ls
 hsh main.c shell.c
 #$
.SS In non-interactive mode
.B
 $ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
 hsh main.c shell.c
 $ echo "/bin/ls -a" | ./hsh
 . .. hsh main.c shell.c
 $
